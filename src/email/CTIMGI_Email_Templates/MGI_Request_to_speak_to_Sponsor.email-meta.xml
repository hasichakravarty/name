Thank you for visiting our CTI and MGI {!Outbound_Notification__c.Preferred_Campus__c} campus on {!Outbound_Notification__c.Current_Date__c} . We are really excited that you are considering us as your preferred Higher Education Institution.

Often they will have their own set of questions and I would like to invite them to come and meet with me to discuss any queries they may have. Please ask your parent or guardian to contact me on {!Outbound_Notification__c.Preferred_Campus_Phone__c} or {!Outbound_Notification__c.Sender_Email__c}  to schedule an appointment.
