    <textOnly>Dear {!Outbound_Notification__c.Contact_First_Name__c} {!Outbound_Notification__c.Contact_Last_Name__c}

I hereby confirm that we have received your R800 registration fee. Please note this fee is non-refundable.

To secure your registration for {!Outbound_Notification__c.Current_Date_Year__c}, please submit the following documentation and make the following payment and as soon as possible so that we can process your student number:

• Completed and signed registration forms
• Signed Repayment Calculator
• Signed Addendum A
• Signed Social Indemnity form
• A copy of student’s ID
• A copy of sponsor’s ID

Please contact me in order to confirm that I have received all documentation after it has been sent. Faxed and e-mailed documentation will be accepted; however the originals must be submitted upon enrolment on {!Outbound_Notification__c.Academic_Start_Date__c}.

In order to secure the {!Outbound_Notification__c.Earlybird__c} fees, an early-bird deposit is required on or before {!Outbound_Notification__c.Early_Bird_Date__c}. The early-bird deposit, excluding the registration fee, will be deducted from the first month’s payment. Please note however, failure to pay the early-bird deposit will result in the {!Outbound_Notification__c.Academic_Start_Date_Year__c} fees being applicable (estimated increase of 8%-15% in {!Outbound_Notification__c.Current_Date_Year__c}).

If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards
